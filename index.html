PROJECTS


Wheat Price Correlation Project - https://github.com/mrness/Prediction_Prices_Of_Wheat
With this project I set out to better understand what factors may be correlated to the increase in wheat prices. By using python, data analysis and visualization libraries, and time series analysis, I was able to get some interesting results.

Twitter Sentiment Analysis - https://github.com/mrness/twitter-stock-analysis_f
The premise of this project is to explore the relationship between twitter activity and a potentially related stock. Specifically, I aimed to answer if there is a lead-lag correlation between sentiment of twitter mentions of a user and some stock price. The end goal is a tool that takes in a twitter handle, stock ticker, and day of interest, performs sentiment analysis on tweet mentions, and correlates aggregated sentiment against the stock price movements to see if there is any lead/ lag correlation.
